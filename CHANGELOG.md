# Changelog

## 1.7.0

- **Reactive authoring island (Vue 3).** The rule list + editor is now a buildless Vue 3 app — `vue.esm-browser.js` loaded via ESM importmap, no bundler, no Node. A `reactive()` working copy with snapshot-stack undo replaces the old server-side `workingCopy`; unsaved edits are guarded by `beforeunload`. See ADR-0009, ADR-0010. (M6)
- **JSON API for the island.** `GET /_ui/api/rules` seeds the app; `POST /_ui/api/save` persists the whole working copy (validated server-side, atomic swap). Dry-run, probe, and template-preview are JSON round-trips to the same server-side Go engines — no matcher/template logic duplicated in JS.
- **Removed:** Alpine.js, htmx, server-side `workingCopy`, and the old form-encoded editor endpoints. The observation surface (journal, match explanations, shell) is now server-rendered Templ + native `EventSource` + plain DOM `CustomEvent`s for cross-surface actions.
- **Template autocomplete.** Typing `{{` in a response body textarea opens a suggestion dropdown of all template variables and functions; after `{{.` it shows only dot-prefixed field accessors. Arrow keys / Enter / Tab / click to select; Esc to dismiss. Filters by prefix match on every keystroke.

## 1.6.0

- **Path parameters.** A new `path_mode: pattern` matches templated paths where each `{name}` captures one path segment — `/users/{id}` matches `/users/42` but not `/users/42/edit` or `/users` — mirroring `net/http` ServeMux and OpenAPI path templating. Placeholder names are validated for well-formedness and uniqueness at startup. (M4)
- **`{{.Param "id"}}` template accessor.** Read captured path parameters in a `template: true` response — from a `pattern` path or a `regex` path's named groups (`(?P<id>…)`). A missing name renders empty, so it never errors.
- **Response header values are templated too** when `template: true` (keys stay literal), so a `201` can return `Location: /users/{{.Param "id"}}`. A header template error falls back to the raw value rather than failing the response.

## 1.5.0

- **Self-diagnosing library assertions.** A failed `Verify*` now prints each received request's body, and — when the `Match` carried a `JSONBody` — names the first JSON path that differed (`↳ JSONBody.amount: got 300, want 500`). The near-miss debug identity now pays rent inside a Go test, not just the Web UI. (M3)
- **`Match` gains `Query` and `Headers`.** Assert the query params and headers your code sent, alongside `JSONBody`. A non-empty value matches exactly; an empty value asserts presence. The Journal's redacted sensitive headers are matchable by presence only, so the v1.0.1 redaction is untouched, and the frozen `/__admin/` filter semantics are unchanged (matching is done in the library layer).
- **`StartT(t, yaml)`.** A testing-aware constructor that fatals on a bad config and auto-closes the mock via `t.Cleanup` — no more `if err != nil` / `defer m.Close()` boilerplate, and a forgotten close can't leak a goroutine or port. `Start` stays for non-test use.

## 1.4.0

- **Journal shows the sequence position.** A request matched by a sequenced rule is annotated with which response served it — `→ poll job  seq 2/3` — in the live journal and the `/__admin/requests` JSON (`seq_pos`/`seq_total`). Answers "why did I get this response on this call?" at a glance. The position is clamped once the sequence is exhausted (last sticks).
- **Fix:** a request matched by a rule with no `name` rendered as "✖ no match" in the journal (matched-vs-not was keyed off the name, not whether a rule matched). It now shows `→ (unnamed)` and links to the rule; matched-detection uses the rule id.

## 1.3.0

- **Edit sequenced responses in the Web UI.** The response editor gains an ordered, editable list: add a second response to make a rule sequenced, reorder with up/down, delete back to one to return to a single response. Sequenced rules are no longer read-only in the UI. See ADR-0008.
- **Fix:** duplicating a sequenced rule silently dropped its `responses` list (the editor form never carried it), producing a single-response copy. Duplicate now preserves the full sequence (with a fresh id, hence a fresh position).
- Internally, the responses list crosses the UI boundary as one hidden JSON field, and IDs are now assigned before validation on every write path — which also closes a latent gap where an id-less sequenced rule could bypass the "explicit id" guard on save (noted in ADR-0007).

## 1.2.0

- **Sequenced responses** — a rule may carry an ordered `responses:` list instead of a single `response:`; the Nth matching request gets the Nth response and the last one sticks. Covers 202→200 polling, 500→200 retry, and pagination. Matching stays stateless; the position is tracked per-rule outside the rule set and survives `SIGHUP` reload. See ADR-0007.
- **Sequenced rules require an explicit `id:`** — the position is keyed by id, so a rule without a stable id would silently reset on reload; this is now a validation error. `response:` and `responses:` are mutually exclusive.
- **Reset rewinds sequences** — `m.Reset()` and the new `POST /__admin/reset` clear the journal *and* rewind every sequence to its first response (test isolation). `DELETE /__admin/requests` is unchanged (journal-only).
- The Web UI shows sequenced rules read-only (they're YAML-authored); editing one there is rejected rather than flattening the list.

## 1.1.0

- **Embeddable Go library** (`github.com/flipmorsch/mock-server/mock`) — run the mock in-process from Go tests: `mock.Start(yaml)` on a random loopback port, `URL`/`Close`/`Reset`/`Received`, and `Verify`/`VerifyCalled`/`VerifyMatch`/`VerifyAtLeast`/`VerifyAtMost`/`Count`/`CountMatch`. Failed assertions list what was actually received. See ADR-0006.
- **Module renamed** to `github.com/flipmorsch/mock-server` (enables `go get` and `go install`).
- **JSON subset body matching** — request bodies can be matched with `mode: json` (rules) or `Match{JSONBody: ...}` (library): partial objects, element-wise arrays, equal scalars.
- **Response capture** — the journal now records the status and body the mock returned (visible in `/__admin/requests` and `Received()`).

## 1.0.1

- **Fix:** request counts (`requestCount` template func and `/__admin/requests/count`) were capped by the 200-entry journal ring buffer and silently undercounted past 200 requests. Total / method / exact-path counts are now sound via monotonic tallies, independent of the display window.
- **Security:** sensitive request headers (`Authorization`, `Cookie`, API keys) are redacted in the journal and `/__admin/` API; the server warns at startup when binding to a non-loopback address, since the journal and admin API are unauthenticated.

## 1.0.0

- **TLS** — `--tls` serves HTTPS with an auto-generated self-signed certificate (SHA-256 fingerprint logged at startup), or `--tls-cert`/`--tls-key` for a provided pair. Single HTTP-or-HTTPS listener; HTTP/2 via ALPN. See ADR-0005.
- **Hot reload** — send `SIGHUP` (headless only) to atomically reload rules from the config file; an invalid file leaves the running rules unchanged. See ADR-0004.

Both were the last deferred backlog items. 1.0 marks the YAML config schema, the CLI flags, and the `/__admin/` JSON API as stable (breaking changes → 2.0); the `/_ui/` fragment endpoints are internal and exempt.
